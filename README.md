# Arduino
[Longer Vision Robot](http://www.longervisionrobot.com  target="_blank") Arduino Examples:

A lot of examples are grabbed from popular open source. For Longer Vision Technology, our Arduino examples come from 3 resourses:

1) [Adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit  target="_blank")

2) [Arduino Step by Step online course](https://github.com/futureshocked/arduino_sbs  target="_blank")

3) [Commercial course contents coming with the Sensor Kit for Arduino (37 sensors)](http://www.longervisionrobot.com/en/products/iot-sensors.html  target="_blank")


Every example starts with two digits "XY" and a underscore "_", which is to be used in the XYth class.
For instance, 02_TemperatureHumidity_DHT11.ino is to be used in the 2nd class.
