# Arduino
[Longer Vision Robot](https://www.longervisionrobot.com) Arduino Examples:

A lot of examples are grabbed from popular open source. For Longer Vision Technology, our Arduino examples come from 3 resourses:

1) Adafruit:
https://github.com/adafruit

2) Arduino Step by Step online course
https://github.com/futureshocked/arduino_sbs

3) Commercial course contents coming with the Sensor Kit for Arduino (37 sensors)


Every example starts with two digits "XY" and a underscore "_", which is to be used in the XYth class.
For instance, 02_TemperatureHumidity_DHT11.ino is to be used in the 2nd class.
